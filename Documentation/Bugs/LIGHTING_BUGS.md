## Bug 09: Cross-Chunk Blocklight Lost on Rapid Place/Break at Chunk Border

**Severity:** Medium-High
**Status:** Open

**Description:**
When rapidly breaking and re-placing a blocklight source (e.g., a torch or glowstone) at a chunk border — specifically in Chunk A adjacent to Chunk B — the lighting engine can fail to propagate the blocklight emission into Chunk B, or fail to emit light entirely in both chunks. Two distinct failure modes are observed:

1. **Partial propagation:** Chunk A receives the blocklight correctly, but Chunk B stays dark — the cross-chunk BFS propagation is silently skipped.
2. **Total emission loss:** Neither Chunk A nor Chunk B receives any blocklight, despite the emissive block being physically present in the world.

The issue is **not permanent** — forcing a lighting update on the affected chunk(s) (e.g., placing/breaking another block nearby) correctly re-triggers the BFS and restores proper lighting. This suggests the light data is not corrupted, but rather the emission seeding or cross-chunk mod delivery is being dropped during a specific race window.

**Reproduction Steps:**

1. Enter a world and navigate to a chunk border (ideally underwater in an ocean biome for easier reproduction).
2. Place a blocklight source (e.g., Jack O' Lantern) in Chunk A, directly adjacent to the Chunk B border.
3. Break the light source and immediately re-place it. Repeat rapidly.
4. Observe that after several cycles, Chunk B (or both chunks) may fail to update with the new blocklight.

**Aggravating factors:**

- **Fluid-heavy chunks significantly increase reproduction rate.** Testing underwater in ocean biomes shows noticeably slower cross-chunk light updates compared to non-fluid biomes. The additional voxel modifications from fluid flow (e.g., water flowing back into the broken block's position) likely create contention with the lighting job pipeline — either by flooding the deferred cross-chunk mod queue or by causing the chunk's lighting job to be scheduled/cancelled repeatedly before cross-chunk mods are delivered.
- **IL2CPP master build timing:** All testing was performed in a release IL2CPP build. Mono/Editor builds would be slower overall, potentially widening or narrowing the race window.

**Root Cause Suspected:**
A race condition in the cross-chunk blocklight mod delivery path. When a blocklight source is broken and re-placed in rapid succession while the chunk is simultaneously undergoing other voxel modifications (fluid re-flow), one of the following likely occurs:

- The removal pass's deferred cross-chunk mods for Chunk B are still in flight when the new placement triggers a fresh lighting job, causing the new emission's cross-chunk mods to be dropped or overwritten.
- The chunk's lighting job is cancelled and re-scheduled due to the concurrent voxel modification (fluid flow), and the re-scheduling loses the pending blocklight emission seed.
- The deferred cross-chunk mod queue for Chunk B is processed against stale snapshot data, causing the mods to be silently discarded as no-ops.

**Validation suite (June 2026):** Every production scheduling behavior modelable in the synchronous harness was exercised across five layers — direct-harness single/both-in-flight interleaving, frame-simulator `ContainsKey` in-flight guard / budget throttling / completion-order sensitivity, multi-frame held flights, fluid-flow contention (Air→Water opacity 0→2 injecting BFS nodes mid-flight), and seeded iteration-order randomness (Fisher-Yates shuffles, 50 seeds) — plus the combined ocean-biome stress test. All converged to the oracle across every tested
seed and ordering.

> **Consolidated 2026-06-14** (see [LIGHTING_VALIDATION_HARNESS_FIDELITY.md](../Architecture/Testing%20Framework/LIGHTING_VALIDATION_HARNESS_FIDELITY.md) §5): the deterministic single-instance permutations folded into two representatives — **B15** (direct-harness break+place, single- then both-in-flight) and **B16** (fluid break→water→place under a held flight + single-slot budget) — backed by **B22** (dual-chunk both-in-flight), **B26–B29** (50-seed shuffled sweeps: fluid contention, budget pressure, dual-chunk interleave, combined stress), and **B40
** (cross-chunk
> geometry fuzz). The retired numbers B17–B21 / B23–B25 are intentionally unused. Coverage of every behavior above is preserved by these survivors.

The Bug 07/08 cross-chunk mod delivery fixes were already present when Bug 09 was last observed — the bug is either a genuine async race condition (Burst job system timing, IL2CPP memory ordering) that synchronous `.Run()` cannot reproduce, or is no longer present in the current codebase. A faithful failing repro is still TODO before this bug's fix can be test-driven; the surviving baselines serve as regression guards.

**Plan update (2026-07-03 analysis — see [LIGHTING_ASYNC_BUG_VALIDATION_ROADMAP.md](../Design/LIGHTING_ASYNC_BUG_VALIDATION_ROADMAP.md)):** the environment this bug was observed in has since changed twice — MT-2 (`LightWorkScheduler` ready/waiting split, 2026-07-02) replaced the scheduler it raced against, and TG-4 fluid-Burst (June 2026) replaced the managed fluid tick that was its main aggravating factor. Three follow-ups are specced: **AS-2** (model the MT-2 park/promote layer in the frame simulator — a *missed-promotion stall* is exactly this bug's
symptom shape and is sync-testable), **AS-4** (real-`Schedule()` parallel-determinism gate covering pooled-buffer aliasing, the remaining plausible in-editor race), and **AS-5** (automated in-build stress rig — also the cheap way to **re-verify the bug still exists** before further investment).

**Candidate synchronous repro lead (2026-07-12 — from the C11 interrupted-reconciliation fuzz):** the fuzz's diagonal 4-chunk-corner geometry (two equal-color lamps at a corner, e.g. `(31,64,31)`/`(32,64,32)`, water, ≥3 interrupted break/re-place cycles with a held neighbor flight + under-budgeted waves) leaves a stable, **under-bright** region *above* the water near the corner — cross-chunk blocklight the surviving lamp legitimately casts that is never delivered by the interrupted schedule (a clean relight of the identical final voxel state matches the borderless oracle exactly, so it is a delivery/schedule gap, not a BFS/oracle defect). This is the Bug 09 shape (cross-chunk blocklight lost after rapid place/break at a border), reproduced **synchronously** in the harness — the first such lead. Not yet confirmed as Bug 09 vs a harness-fidelity artifact (the diagonal corner is not a face-adjacent pair, and the fuzz recipe hand-schedules only 2 of the 4 corner chunks, unlike production which wakes all neighbors). The C11 fuzz (baseline **B91**) is deliberately scoped to face-adjacent seams and excludes this geometry; investigating this lead is TODO (candidate axis for **AS-4**/**AS-5**).

**Testing environment:** IL2CPP master build, ocean biome (underwater), June 2026.
